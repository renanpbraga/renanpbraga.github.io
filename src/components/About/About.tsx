                I'm Renan Braga, {age} years old, full-stack developer, and I've
                been working as a front-end developer since 2021. I studied web
                development at Trybe, one of the best web development schools in
                Brazil. I'm experienced in development using Javascript and
                Typescript, React and Angular in adition to other libraries and
                frameworks.

                I have a MSc. degree in Agronomy from Universidade Federal Rural

                Instead of all this technical aspect of my background, I also
                developed soft skills during all these years, like comunication,
                empathy, leadership and management skills, adaptability and
